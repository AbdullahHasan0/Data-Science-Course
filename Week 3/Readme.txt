Gameplay
The game will start by displaying a welcome message and the initial state of the word with underscores representing each letter.

You will be prompted to guess a letter by entering it in the console.

After each guess, the game will update the display, showing the correctly guessed letters and revealing their positions in the word.

If you guess a letter correctly, the display will be updated, and you can continue guessing until you either complete the word or run out of lives.

The hangman figure and the remaining lives will be displayed after each incorrect guess.

The game will continue until you either successfully guess the entire word or run out of lives.

At the end of the game, the console will display a message announcing whether you won or lost, along with the correct word if you lose.
